# Hello! Welcome to my portfolio
Hi! I'm Rub√©n, a student passionate about software development with a special focus on areas such as artificial intelligence,
machine learning, big data, databases, and web application design. From a young age, I've felt a deep fascination with technology
and its ability to transform the way we live and work.

My journey into the world of programming began with curiosity about understanding how things work behind the screen. As I delved into
the study of software engineering, I discovered my passion for developing innovative solutions that harness the full power of technology.

Here you'll find a variety of projects that reflect my interests and skills in different areas of programming.

In summary, my goal is to continue exploring the frontiers of technology and contribute to the development of innovative solutions that
